Regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value, such as “salary” or “weight”. Many different models can be used, the simplest is the linear regression. It tries to fit data with the best hyper-plane which goes through the points.

Models: Multiple Linear Regression , Polynomial Regression , Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression,Random Forest Regression



I Used libraries like Numpy for math ,Pandas for along an axis of the DataFrame , matplotlib for creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels and Finally seaborn for making statistical graphics in Python , scikit learn

Requirements : python7.3
